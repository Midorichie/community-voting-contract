# Community Voting Contract - Phase 2

A comprehensive decentralized voting system built on Stacks blockchain with enhanced security features and token-weighted governance capabilities.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Voting System
- **Proposal Creation**: Community members can create proposals with customizable voting periods
- **Weighted Voting**: Support for voter weight assignments and token-based voting power
- **Secure Voting**: Prevents double voting and ensures voting period compliance
- **Proposal Execution**: Automatic execution based on quorum and approval thresholds
- **Vote Delegation**: Users can delegate their voting power to trusted representatives

### Security Enhancements
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for proposal creation and administration
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and state changes
- **Time-based Controls**: Enforced voting periods with start/end block validation
- **Emergency Controls**: Proposal cancellation capabilities for proposers and admins

### Token Integration
- **SIP-010 Compatibility**: Works with standard Stacks tokens
- **Token Locking**: Prevents vote manipulation through token transfers during voting
- **Delegation System**: Advanced vote delegation with power tracking

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) >= 1.5.0
- Stacks wallet for testing

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd community-voting-contract

# Check contract syntax
clarinet check

# Run tests
clarinet test

# Start local development environment
clarinet integrate
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Creating a Proposal
```clarity
;; Create a new proposal with 1 week voting period
(contract-call? .community-voting create-proposal 
  "Upgrade community treasury allocation" 
  u1008)  ;; ~1 week in blocks
```

### Voting on Proposals
```clarity
;; Vote YES on proposal #1
(contract-call? .community-voting vote u1 true)

;; Vote NO on proposal #1  
(contract-call? .community-voting vote u1 false)
```

### Executing Approved Proposals
```clarity
;; Execute proposal after voting period ends
(contract-call? .community-voting execute-proposal u1)
```

### Token-Weighted Voting
```clarity
;; Lock tokens for voting power
(contract-call? .token-voting lock-tokens-for-voting 
  u1      ;; proposal-id
  u1000   ;; token amount
  'SP1234...TOKEN-CONTRACT)

;; Delegate voting power
(contract-call? .token-voting delegate-voting-power 'SP5678...DELEGATE)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Key Parameters
- **Minimum Voting Period**: 144 blocks (~1 day)
- **Maximum Voting Period**: 1008 blocks (~1 week) 
- **Quorum Threshold**: 100 total votes required
- **Default Execution Threshold**: 60% approval required
- **Token Lock Period**: 1008 blocks (~1 week)

### Administrative Functions
```clarity
;; Set voter weights (admin only)
(contract-call? .community-voting set-voter-weight 'SP1234...USER u5)

;; Transfer contract ownership
(contract-call? .community-voting transfer-ownership 'SP5678...NEW-OWNER)

;; Configure governance token
(contract-call? .token-voting set-governance-token 'SP9999...TOKEN)
```
